							<h2 class="major">Rules of Play</h2>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/check-yourself.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Seeing as most competitors in the BPDGC field have the attention span of a gnat, the BPDGC 
								has distilled the basic rules of disc golf to the following list. It is not all-inclusive, and any 
								questions or “creative” interpretations of such rules shall be subject to the final discretion of the 
								tournament directors, Chris and Kelly. Bribes are encouraged and will be accepted.</p>

							<p>The object of disc golf is to have fun and complete the course in the fewest throws. Safety and 
								courtesy are important. Be careful of plants, rocks, unsteady footing and other competitors. 
								Throw only when the landing area is clear of other competitors.</p>

								<ol>
								<li>Start from the teeing area. Each teeing area will be marked by two small flags placed in 
								the ground. The player must throw and release the disc from behind the front of the 
								teeing area.</li><br />
								<li>Subsequent shots are played from behind the spot where the previous shot came to rest. 
								This spot is known as the “lie.” If your disc comes to rest in a tree or a bush, as I’m sure a 
								lot of your terrible throws will, the lie is the spot on the ground directly below.</li><br />
								<li>The player may not move an obstacle in order to make room for a throwing motion.</li><br />
								<li>After the tee-off the player whose disc is farthest from the hole always throws first. The 
								player with the least number of throws on the previous hole is the first to tee-off on the 
								next hole.</li><br />
								<li>“Gimme” puts are not permitted in tournament play.</li><br />
								<li>A run-up and follow through are allowed, but the player must release the disc before 
								stepping past the lie or the front of the tee pad.</li><br />
								<li>A putt is a throw from within 10 meters (32.8 ft) of the target. When putting, you may not 
								step past your lie until the disc comes to rest.</li><br />
								<li>The hole is completed when the disc comes to rest in the basket or chains. The hole is not 
								completed if the disc is resting on the top of the target.</li><br />
								<li>If a shot goes out-of-bounds: play from either the last in-bounds location with a 1-stroke 
								penalty or retee with a 1-stroke penalty.</li><br />
								<li>The only out of bounds on the BPDGC course will be when your disc is fully submerged 
								in the lake. All other landing spots are considered in bounds and playable. For streams 
								and or/other small bodies of water, the player's lie may be relocated to the nearest lie 
								which is farther from the target and is on the line of play, at the nearest point that 
								provides relief.</li><br />

												<td><strong>Brandon "Crazy Legs" Learned</strong>
													<br /><br />
													If the Black Pond Disc Golf Classic was a road race, the entire field would
													forfeit to Brandon "Crazy Legs" Learned. Rumored to run half marathons for

													for him to excel on the back nine when the rest of his out-of-shape-shit-show

													<br /><br />
													A well-known competitor in the Dutchess County disc golf scene, Charlie “The
													Dover Dynamo” Asselmeyer will be looking to build on his pristine record this
													weekend at the inaugural BPDGC. Rumored to be more excited for the
													inaugural BPDGC than his upcoming colonoscopy, Charlie “The Dover
													Dynamo” will be ready to play come Saturday.</td>

													If it weren’t for Charlie “The Albany Assassin” Asselmeyer and his graciously
													bestowing the sport of disc golf at our feet, none of us would be at this silly
													tournament or know what the hell those metal cages in parks actually were.
													While many of you will likely curse young Charlie for this introduction as
													you’re searching for your discs in pricker bushes this weekend, he cares not.
													A true professional, The Albany Assassin will look to plant himself at the top
													of the leaderboard and remain there throughout the tournament.</td>

													<br /><br />
													Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods, Santa Claus, Chris Ryder - all people at the top
													of their crafts. One fan, among his many fans, recently commented "watching
													Chris throw a disc is like watching Michelangelo paint the Sistine Chapel."
													The field is in for a treat this weekend just being in his presence. You’re all
													very welcome.</td>

												<td><strong>Cory “The Southhampton Slinger” O’Farrell (f/k/a “The Pelham Pistol”,
													f/k/a “The Garrison Great”)</strong>
													<br /><br />
													Looking to rise up the leaderboard just as quickly as his skyrocketing Tesla
													stock, Cory “the Southhampton Slinger” is ready to make his mark on a
													star-studded BPDGC field. Rumored to have moved to Long Island because
													Putnam County didn’t have fields long enough to contain his smashing
													forehand drives, this competitor's dedication to his craft will stymie many an
													opponent's advances this weekend.</td>

											<tr>
												<td style="vertical-align: middle;text-align: center;"><img src="images/players/males/dan-mcgee.png" alt="" /></td>
												<td><strong>Dan "The Brain" McGee</strong>
													<br /><br />
													Disc golf for "The Brain" is just as much a mental exercise as it is physical.
													Knowledge of wind speed, elevation and angles are his strong suit. If he
													brings a barometer to judge atmospheric pressure and its impact on the
													various types of plastic in his bag, he's disqualified.</td>

												<td style="vertical-align: middle;text-align: center;"><img src="images/players/males/ezra-neuman.png" alt="" /></td>
												<td><strong>Ezra “the Sizzling Chef” Neuman</strong>
													<br /><br />
													Equally comfortable carving a turkey as he is carving up a fairway, Ezra “The
													Sizzling Chef” Neuman will be ready to pummel his competition into a fine,
													perfectly-seasoned garnish this weekend. Keep the kitchen utensils away
													from this one on Saturday, lest you give him any help serving up a can of
													whoop-ass on this unsuspecting field of competitors.</td>
											</tr>

												<td style="vertical-align: middle;text-align: center;"><img src="images/players/males/jack-ofarrell.png" alt="" /></td>
												<td><strong>Jack "The Eraser" O'Farrell</strong>
													<br /><br />
													Known for his uncanny ability to throw 10 shots on a hole but only post a
													score of 4, Jack "The Eraser" O'Farrell can make strokes disappear with
													ease. What Jack lacks in mathematical prowess he more than makes up for
													with his impeccable disc golf skills.</td>
											</tr>

												<td style="vertical-align: middle;text-align: center;"><img src="images/players/males/jimmy-asselmeyer.png" alt="" /></td>
												<td><strong>Jimmy “The One Disc Wonder” Asselmeyer</strong>
													<br /><br />
													What do Lance Armstrong and Jimmy “the One Disc Wonder” Asselmeyer
													have in common? They only need one working tool to be successful. When
													asked why he limited himself to one disc for his entire disc golf career, this
													competitor responded with “to give my opponents a fighting chance.” Such
													ability and confidence will be needed this weekend against a tough field of
													multi-disc competitors.</td>

												<td style="vertical-align: middle;text-align: center;"><img src="images/players/males/john-axelrod.png" alt="" /></td>
												<td><strong>John “No Relation to David” Axelrod</strong>
													<br /><br />
													While still an unknown commodity in the Northeast disc golf circuit, John “No
													Relation to David” Axelrod has been busy making a name for himself on the
													Mid-Atlantic frisbee-flinging scene. Fighting climate change in the morning and
													slingin’ discs at night, John No Relation to David Axelrod will be looking to take
													the BPDGC field by surprise in the first tournament of his Northeast swing.</td>
											</tr>

												<td style="vertical-align: middle;text-align: center;"><img src="images/players/males/jon-bixby.png" alt="" /></td>
												<td><strong>Jon "Big Boi" Bixby</strong>
													<br /><br />
													When Jon was told that he could spend 6 hours in the woods with limited cell
													service away from Lauren, Jon "Big Boi" Bixby jumped at the opportunity. Well,
													not literally, of course, since Lauren recently tripped him and broke his ankle,
													preventing any real "jumping." He still doesn't know we're playing disc golf, but
													we could have sold him on this tournament if he were getting a root canal.</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td style="vertical-align: middle;text-align: center;"><img src="images/players/males/jose-velez.png" alt="" /></td>
												<td><strong>Jose “Silent But Deadly” Velez</strong>
													<br /><br />
													A man of few words, Jose lets his game do the talking. Slinging drinks at
													night and discs during the day, Jose will throw pretty much anything you put
													in front of him...so be careful. Such dedication and practice makes him a top
													competitor to watch this weekend.</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td style="vertical-align: middle;text-align: center;"><img src="images/players/males/max-brashear.png" alt="" /></td>
												<td><strong>Max "The Legal Eagle" Brashear</strong>
													<br /><br />
													When Max first heard of his invitation to the BPDGC, he quickly put down
													his drink, settled his bar tab and made his way to the nearest disc golf
													course to prepare. Though Max “the Legal Eagle” Brashear has excelled in
													nearly every facet of his career - top of his class at Cornell Law, competing
													on the U.S. Men’s Junior National Soccer Team, living near Ithaca Brewing
													Company - these are all non-disc golf related achievements, and as such,
													are not important. With a good showing this weekend, Max will finally have
													an accomplishment he can be proud of.</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td style="vertical-align: middle;text-align: center;"><img src="images/players/males/michael-asselmeyer.png" alt="" /></td>
												<td><strong>Michael "The Wisconsin Wunderkind" Asselmeyer</strong>
													<br /><br />
													Representing the entire Midwest in the inaugural BPDGC, Michael
													Asselmeyer could provide a formidable foe to many a competitor. He could
													also get distracted by a squirrel and be lost to the woods forever. Someone
													please put a bell on him when he arrives.</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td style="vertical-align: middle;text-align: center;"><img src="images/players/males/patrick-ofarrell.png" alt="" /></td>
												<td><strong>Patrick “The Brooklyn Basher" O'Farrell</strong>
													<br /><br />
													Sensing weakness and athletic inferiority in his competitors after pummeling
													half the BPDGC field in a Brooklyn road race, Patrick "The Brooklyn Basher"
													O'Farrell was all too happy to sign up for another family athletic "competition."
													Unlike the last event though, the only "driving" The Basher is looking to do this
													go around will be with his discs, and not the entire Ryder family with their 2
													tons of luggage an hour and a half upstate.</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td style="vertical-align: middle;text-align: center;"><img src="images/players/males/wayne-ryder.png" alt="" /></td>
												<td><strong>Wayne “Anhyzer-Busch” Ryder</strong>
													<br /><br />
													When Wayne first overheard talk of “anhyzers” landing in the “bushes” he
													knew he had found his sport. While disappointed that his newfound hobby
													lacked any affiliation to his favorite brewery, Wayne “Anyhzer Busch” Ryder
													persevered and continued to hone his skills. He’ll be ready to take on a stiff
													field of competitors this weekend, all with a stiff drink in hand.</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td style="vertical-align: middle;text-align: center;"><img src="images/players/males/will-ofarrell.png" alt="" /></td>
												<td><strong>Will "The Lumberjack" O'Farrell</strong>
													<br /><br />
													Whether in his backyard splitting wood, or out on the disc golf course, trees
													shiver their timbers when Will "The Lumberjack" O’Farrell comes around.
													Once rumored to have felled 48 trees in a single round of disc golf, Will can
													carve up, both literally and figuratively, most courses with ease.<br /><br />
												
													PLAYER'S NOTE: Voice and facial recognition will be in place at all tee pads for competitor
													verification. As Jack and Will are part of a twin package, and the Asselmeyers are unsuspecting rubes, scores should be checked vigorously so as to avoid a Lindsay Lohan "Parent Trap" style of play.

													<br /><br />
													Known for her ability to slice up a disc golf course as easily as a human
													body, Alley "The Surgeon" O'Farrell will be one to watch this weekend. Sharp

													After years of practicing her craft on Long Island, Aimee “The Vanquishing
													Vegan” Neuman has chosen the inaugural BPDGC to make her disc golf

													“excessive cursing,” “flipping off her competitors 63 times” and “brazen nudity.”
